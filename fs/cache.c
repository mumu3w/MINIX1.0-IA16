 * The entry points into this file are:

 *   put_block:	  return a block previously requested with get_block
 *   alloc_zone:  allocate a new zone (to increase the length of a file)
 *   free_zone:	  release a zone (when a file is removed)
 *   rw_block:	  read or write a block from the disk itself
 *   invalidate:  remove all the cache blocks on some device
